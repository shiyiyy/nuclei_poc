    WP Recipe Maker <= 10.2.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_search_recipes' and 'ajax_get_recipe' functions in all versions up to, and including, 10.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive recipe information including draft, pending, and private recipes that they shouldn't be able to access.
