    Disable Admin Notices – Hide Dashboard Notifications <= 1.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Disable Admin Notices – Hide Dashboard Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in the `showPageContent()` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary URLs to the blocked redirects list via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
