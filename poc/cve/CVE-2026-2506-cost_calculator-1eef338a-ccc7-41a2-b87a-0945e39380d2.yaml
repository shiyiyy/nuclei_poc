  name: >
    EM Cost Calculator <= 2.3.1 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'customer_name'
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The EM Cost Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to the plugin storing attacker-controlled 'customer_name' data and rendering it in the admin customer list without output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when an administrator views the EMCC Customers page.
