    User Frontend: AI Powered Frontend Posting, User Directory, Profile, Membership & User Registration <= 4.2.8 - Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The User Frontend: AI Powered Frontend Posting, User Directory, Profile, Membership & User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the 'WPUF_Admin_Settings::check_filetype_and_ext' function and in the 'Admin_Tools::check_filetype_and_ext' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
